      <p className="eso-paragraph-font-size">The Elder Scrolls Online is set in Tamriel during the Second Era, a chaotic period where the continent is divided by political strife, warring factions, and a looming supernatural threat. At the heart of the story is the conflict over the Ruby Throne of the Imperial City, which remains vacant after the Empire’s collapse. Three powerful alliances—the Daggerfall Covenant, the Aldmeri Dominion, and the Ebonheart Pact—vie for control of the throne, hoping to bring stability to the region. Players choose to align with one of these alliances, and the core story follows their journey through this conflict, while also dealing with larger, world-shaking events.</p>
