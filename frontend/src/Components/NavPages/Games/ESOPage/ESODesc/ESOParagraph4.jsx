      <p className="eso-paragraph-font-size">Beyond the main story, the political intrigue between the three alliances adds complexity to the gameâ€™s narrative. Each alliance represents a different faction of races with distinct motivations for seizing control of the Ruby Throne. The Daggerfall Covenant, led by the Bretons, Orcs, and Redguards, seeks to restore order to Tamriel through trade and military might. The Aldmeri Dominion, composed of High Elves, Wood Elves, and Khajiit, aims to unite Tamriel under Elven rule to protect the world from Daedric corruption. The Ebonheart Pact, an uneasy alliance of Nords, Dark Elves, and Argonians, seeks to preserve their autonomy while defending their lands from outside threats. This factional rivalry fuels the ongoing war for the Imperial City, and players engage in PvP combat to push their alliance toward dominance.</p>
