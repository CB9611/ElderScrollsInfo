      <p className="eso-paragraph-font-size">As the player explores the world, they encounter the Five Companions, a group of legendary figures who played pivotal roles in Tamriel’s history. Originally formed to help Emperor Varen Aquilarios reclaim the Ruby Throne, their efforts were sabotaged by Mannimarco, leading to the Emperor's downfall. Throughout the story, the player works alongside these companions—such as the heroic Lyris Titanborn, the cunning Sai Sahan, and the mysterious Prophet (Varen in disguise)—to unravel Molag Bal’s schemes and prevent the destruction of Tamriel. The quest takes them through key locations in Tamriel, from the heart of Cyrodiil to the dark depths of Coldharbour, Molag Bal’s realm in Oblivion.</p>
