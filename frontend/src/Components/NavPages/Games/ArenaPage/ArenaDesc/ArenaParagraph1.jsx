      <p className="arena-paragraph-font-size">The Elder Scrolls: Arena, released in 1994, is the first entry in the Elder Scrolls series and serves as the foundation for the expansive, open-world RPGs that would follow. Set in the fantasy world of Tamriel, Arena introduces players to a sprawling, procedurally generated landscape that includes all of the continent’s provinces, from Cyrodiil to Morrowind. The game’s story begins with the treachery of the Imperial Battlemage Jagar Tharn, who betrays Emperor Uriel Septim VII by imprisoning him in an alternate dimension. Tharn seizes control of the Empire, and the player, initially a prisoner, is tasked with recovering the shattered pieces of the powerful Staff of Chaos in order to defeat Tharn and free the emperor.</p>
