It established Tamriel as a living, breathing world filled with diverse cultures, histories, and conflicts. Arenaâ€™s ambitious scope, allowing players to travel across an entire continent, coupled with its focus on player freedom, set it apart from other RPGs of its time and paved the way for the series' evolution into the rich, immersive worlds seen in later Elder Scrolls games like Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim.</p>
