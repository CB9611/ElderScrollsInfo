      <p className="arena-paragraph-font-size">The game’s main quest revolves around the player’s journey to recover the eight pieces of the Staff of Chaos, each hidden in different dungeons across Tamriel. Arena's story, though more straightforward than later Elder Scrolls titles, features a world filled with dangerous enemies, ancient ruins, and mystical artifacts. Along the way, players can explore various cities, guilds, and temples, interacting with NPCs who offer quests, information, and trading opportunities. Arena also introduced key elements that would become series staples, such as the freedom to create and develop a unique character, an emphasis on exploration, and a massive, non-linear world that players could traverse at their own pace.</p>
