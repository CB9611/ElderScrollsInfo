The game’s story centers on the player’s role as the prophesied Nerevarine, a reincarnation of the legendary Dunmer hero Indoril Nerevar, who is destined to defeat the dark god Dagoth Ur and bring peace to Morrowind. The game opens with the player arriving in the city of Seyda Neen as an unknown outlander, freed by the Emperor’s decree, and tasked with working for the Blades, the Emperor’s secret agents. As the player explores Vvardenfell, they uncover the political, religious, and supernatural forces at play in the province, while slowly piecing together their destiny.</p>
