The central conflict revolves around the Tribunal, a trio of god-kings who have ruled Morrowind for millennia, and their former ally Dagoth Ur, who seeks to use the power of the Heart of Lorkhan to gain dominion over Tamriel. As the Nerevarine, the player is caught in the struggle between the Tribunal’s fading power and Dagoth Ur’s rise. Along the way, they must navigate a web of politics involving the Great Houses, such as House Hlaalu, Telvanni, and Redoran, as well as the Ashlander tribes, who hold ancient prophecies regarding the Nerevarine.</p>
