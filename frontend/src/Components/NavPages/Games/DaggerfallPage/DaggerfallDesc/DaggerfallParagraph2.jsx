      <p className="daggerfall-paragraph-font-size">The main quest of Daggerfall is rich with political intrigue, ancient lore, and multiple factions vying for control of the powerful Numidium. Players can choose different paths as they uncover the truth behind Lysandus’ death and the motivations of the various noble houses, kings, and secret organizations that seek to use the Numidium to reshape Tamriel’s future. Daggerfall’s storyline allows for multiple possible endings, based on player choices, which became a hallmark of the series. These endings reflect the player's decisions regarding alliances and morality, giving the game a sense of depth and replayability. Alongside the main quest, players are free to explore the vast world, join guilds, and complete a nearly limitless number of side quests.</p>
