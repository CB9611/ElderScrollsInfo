      <p className="daggerfall-paragraph-font-size">One of Daggerfall's standout features is its detailed character customization and progression system, which includes a wide range of skills, attributes, and even a complex reputation system. Players can create their own spells, enchant items, and even become a vampire, werewolf, or lycanthrope. The game’s ambition and complexity set it apart from other RPGs of its time, despite some technical limitations and bugs. The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall helped define the series’ identity, emphasizing player freedom, intricate storytelling, and a richly detailed world. Its ambitious scale and depth have earned it a lasting legacy as a key milestone in the development of open-world RPGs.</p>
