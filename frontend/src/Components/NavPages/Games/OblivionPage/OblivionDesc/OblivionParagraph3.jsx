      <p className="oblivion-paragraph-font-size">A significant part of the game focuses on the Blades, an ancient order sworn to protect the Empire and its rulers. The Blades, led by Grandmaster Jauffre, help the player locate Martin and provide guidance throughout the main quest. Martin himself is a complex and compelling characterâ€”a reluctant hero who struggles with the burden of being the last hope for Tamriel. As the player helps Martin discover the tools necessary to defeat Mehrunes Dagon, such as retrieving the Amulet of Kings and acquiring the powerful artifact known as the Daedric Armor, the story builds toward an epic final battle to protect the Imperial City from the Daedric forces.</p>
