      <p className="oblivion-paragraph-font-size">The main antagonist, Mehrunes Dagon, orchestrates a Daedric invasion through the opening of Oblivion Gates across Cyrodiil. These gates serve as portals between Tamriel and Dagon’s plane, unleashing Daedric creatures to terrorize the land. The player’s central task is to close these gates and thwart Dagon’s attempt to merge his realm with the mortal world. To achieve this, the player must find Martin Septim, a former priest living in seclusion, and help him come to terms with his heritage as the last heir to the Septim dynasty. The story takes the player through several major cities and ancient ruins as they gather allies, learn about Daedric magic, and prepare for the final confrontation with Mehrunes Dagon’s forces.</p>
