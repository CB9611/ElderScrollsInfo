      <p className="oblivion-paragraph-font-size">Oblivion’s overarching theme is one of impending doom and the struggle for survival against overwhelming odds. However, it also explores themes of redemption and destiny, particularly through Martin Septim’s arc as he transforms from an unsure scholar into the leader who must sacrifice himself to save Tamriel. The final battle culminates in Martin's transformation into an avatar of Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time, to defeat Mehrunes Dagon in a climactic and visually striking sequence. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is a grand narrative of political upheaval, divine intervention, and the battle between good and evil, all set against the backdrop of a richly immersive open world filled with diverse landscapes, cultures, and challenges for players to explore.</p>
