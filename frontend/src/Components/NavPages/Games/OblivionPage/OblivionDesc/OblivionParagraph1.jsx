      <p className="oblivion-paragraph-font-size">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an open-world role-playing game set in the heart of Tamriel, in the province of Cyrodiil. The game’s story is framed by the assassination of Emperor Uriel Septim VII, which throws the Empire into chaos as the Septim bloodline, protectors of the realm, is severed. In the opening moments of the game, the player finds themselves as a prisoner who becomes entangled in the Emperor’s escape attempt. Before his death, Uriel entrusts the player with an urgent mission: find his illegitimate son, Martin Septim, the last heir to the throne, and stop a looming catastrophe—an invasion by the Daedric Prince Mehrunes Dagon. The main story unfolds as the player seeks to restore order to the Empire by preventing the destruction of the mortal realm by Daedric forces from Oblivion.</p>
