        <p className="daedricduel-desc-font">Daedric Duel is an Elder Scrolls-inspired version of tic-tac-toe that brings the dark, mystical world of Tamriel into a simple yet strategic game. Players choose between two iconic Daedric weapons: crossed Daedric swords for X's and a Daedric bow for O's, battling to claim victory in a 3x3 grid. With every move, players summon the power of Daedric artifacts as they try to outmaneuver their opponent, channeling the energy of the Daedric princes to form a line of three symbols. Daedric Duel combines the timeless fun of tic-tac-toe with the intense, immersive lore of Elder Scrolls, making it a perfect blend of strategy and fantasy.</p>
